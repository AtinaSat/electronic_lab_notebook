With a combination of fantastic software we are able to produce an extensible and reproducible electronic lab notebook! Below I will document the process I used to set up and modify a blogdown workflow to create a framework for electronic lab notebooking.

### Links to the tools

### 1. RStudio

> RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. 

### 2. blogdown

> An open-source (GPL-3) R package to generate static websites based on R Markdown and Hugo.

### 3. Hugo

> **The world’s fastest framework for building websites.** Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

### 4. GitHub

> GitHub brings together the world's largest community of developers to discover, share, and build better software. From open source projects to private team repositories, we're your all-in-one platform for collaborative development.

### 5. Netlify

> Build, deploy, and manage modern web projects. Get an all-in-one workflow that combines global deployment, continuous integration, and HTTPS. And that’s just the beginning. 

#### Note:

To get the above line-up of images (top of page) with links I added some style code to the site css:

```html
 <style>
 #images  {
	 width: 1250px;
	 height: 300px;
 }
 #images img {
	 float: left;
	 width: auto;
	 height: 160px;
	 margin: 0 0 0 15px;
 }
</style>
```

The images are then put in `<div>` elements and are linked via Markdown:

```html
<div id="images">
