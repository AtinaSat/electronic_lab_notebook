We are going to host our final notebook on GitHub, so having access to to-do lists is a nice benefit.

Here's an example:

### Solar System Exploration, 1950s – 1960s

- [ ] Mercury
- [x] Venus
- [x] Earth (Orbit/Moon)
- [x] Mars
- [ ] Jupiter
- [ ] Saturn
- [ ] Uranus
- [ ] Neptune
- [ ] Comet Haley

... and the Markdown that creates this:

```

So we can create to-do lists for specific days/projects/assignments etc.
