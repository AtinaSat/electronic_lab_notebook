## Linear regression

We will use the `mtcars` data, specifically the miles per gallon (mpg) versus the weight (wt) - we obviously expect to see a strong association between these two variables.  
```{r}
fit <- lm(mpg~wt, data=mtcars)
summary(fit)
```

## Plotting

We can create a simple scatter plot of mpg vs wt an then fit the regression line to this:
```{r}
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt, pch = 19, col = 'cadetblue', xlab = 'mpg', ylab = 'wt')
abline(lm(wt~mpg, data=mtcars), lty = 2, lwd = 2, col = 'grey65')
```
